      <h2><span id="sessionsH2" class="h2-in">Work Preferences and Options for Collaboration</span></h2>

      <p>When it comes to completing tasks, I offer two approaches to suit your preferences and desired level of involvement:</p>

      <h3>1. Remote Live Sessions</h3>

      <p>During a remote live session, we can securely connect either my computer to yours or vice versa to share desktop controls. This setup allows you to oversee my work in real time, observe the steps I take, and even learn repeatable processes if you'd like. It also ensures enhanced security, as I can access sensitive information directly on your system without needing to store it elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, connecting to my computer gives you the flexibility to interact with the tools I use, should you choose to do so. In either case, we can work collaboratively, with all time spent fully transparent and verifiable.</p>

      <h3>2. Screen Recording</h3>

      <p>If you prefer to delegate tasks without live involvement, I can record the entire session. This way, you have a video record of the work completed, enabling you to review and learn the steps I performed if needed.</p>

      <h3>Commitment to Efficient and High-Quality Work</h3>

      <p>I am dedicated to ensuring that every hour you invest in my services delivers clear value. For repetitive tasks, I strive to automate where possible or recommend that simpler, recurring actions—such as posting pre-prepared content—be handled by yourself or another team member. This ensures your time and budget are focused on the most impactful work.</p>
      
      <h3>Open to Feedback and Collaboration</h3>
      
      <p>Your satisfaction is my top priority. I openly welcome both constructive criticism and positive feedback to continuously improve my performance. If you find someone who provides exceptional results and choose to work with them instead, I’d see that as a great opportunity for mutual growth—I’d be happy to meet and collaborate with them to enhance both of our skills.</p>

    <page name="workshops" id="workshops" class="hidden-top">
      <h2><span id="workshopsH2" class="h2-in">Developer Workshops: Welcoming All Skill Levels</span></h2>

      <p>In addition to providing client services, I take great pleasure in supporting developers of all experience levels—from complete beginners to seasoned professionals—as they work toward their development goals.</p>
      
      <h3>Workshops for Beginners</h3>

      <p>These sessions are perfect for those who have never written a line of code but are eager to discover how easy-to-learn skills can lead to the creation of functional and powerful web components. There’s no rigid curriculum; instead, I tailor each session to meet learners exactly where they are, focusing on what they want to achieve. Along the way, I introduce related concepts and tools, providing learners with additional opportunities to expand their knowledge and make the most of our time together.</p>
      
      <h3>Workshops for Experienced Developers</h3>

      <p>For experienced developers, workshops often center on their current projects or advanced topics they want to explore but may not have the time to learn on their own. I assist with solving complex challenges that arise in their professional work, offering valuable insights and solutions based on my decade of experience. Whether it’s overcoming a blind spot, tackling difficult frameworks, or resolving technical issues in development environments, I’m here to help. With the right guidance, nearly anything is achievable.</p>

      <h3>Taking Your Skills to the Next Level</h3>

      <p>Remote workdays are designed to start with foundational skills and gradually incorporate more advanced, experience-based techniques. Not all developers have the same level of experience, and this can occasionally lead to challenges that employers find frustrating. I provide assisted starts for developers who need additional support, helping them meet deadlines while building their confidence and skills.</p>

      <p>For teams, I encourage a collaborative approach where one developer may take the lead on urgent tasks, allowing others to learn in a hands-on manner. This dynamic not only ensures productivity but also fosters skill development without unnecessary competition. By working as a team, developers gain both experience and trust from their remote employers, creating a win-win environment.</p>
      
      <hr>
      
      <p>Whether you're just starting your coding journey or tackling advanced challenges, my workshops are designed to empower you with the skills and confidence to succeed. Let’s unlock your potential and take your development expertise to the next level!</p>

    <page name="development" id="development" class="hidden-top">
      <h2><span id="developmentH2" class="h2-in">Passion for Development</span></h2>

      <p>I have a deep passion for development—and the experience to back it up. Over the years, I’ve worked alongside some of the best web developers in the United States, learning from them while sharing my own insights daily. Those collaborations were invaluable, and I hope to create many more similarly meaningful relationships again in the future.</p>
      
      <h3>Seamless Team Integration</h3>

      <p>If your team uses tools like Slack, Basecamp, Jira, Asana, or similar platforms to manage projects and facilitate communication, I can either adapt quickly to your existing workflow or even develop custom software tailored to meet your specific needs. This ensures your processes remain centered on your team’s natural rhythm and productivity.</p>

      <p>For collaborative coding, tools like GitHub or Visual Studio integrations are essential. I’m highly proficient in using these tools, so I can integrate with your team seamlessly from day one, functioning like a seasoned pro within your established systems.</p>
      
      <h3>Navigating Frameworks and CMS Challenges</h3>

      <p>Frameworks like React and Angular, or platforms like Sitecore, come with unique challenges. These tools often require significant adjustment due to their overhead, which can only truly be understood and utilized effectively within a team context. React and Angular are often customized with team-specific packages, while Sitecore frequently repurposes existing components in a way that can be limiting. Without careful management, investments in these technologies can lead to significant time and resource loss. I’ve seen scenarios where weeks of effort and substantial budgets yield minimal returns.</p>
      
      <h3>My Expertise: Clean, Purposeful Code</h3>

      <p>Where I truly excel is in crafting solutions from scratch—developing code with intention, clarity, and efficiency. I specialize in refactoring code to make it cleaner, more readable, and easier to communicate across teams. If effective communication and collaboration around code aren’t priorities for a team member, it may be more suitable for them to take on a role where these skills aren’t as critical. I’m committed to fostering a collaborative environment where clear and deliberate coding practices drive success.</p>

      <p>By combining my passion, technical expertise, and adaptability, I bring high-quality, practical solutions to any team or project.</p>
